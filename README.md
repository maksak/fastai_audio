# fastai_audio

This is an experimental and unofficial module add-on for the new [`fastai v1`](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) library.  It adds the capability of audio classification to fastai by loading raw audio files and generating spectrograms on the fly.  Please check out the notebooks directory for usage examples.
